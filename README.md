# term-chat

A terminal chat app.  I am building the project to help me both learn
server development and tui development in rust. 


### Radon
Radon is the server for the app.  It is structured as a standard rest server with WS 
endpoints for chatting. 

### Xenon 
Xenon is the terminal client for the app.  It uses ratatui which appears to be the dominant
rust tui library.


IM NOT DONE HERE - I WILL LEARN HOW TO BUILD THIS
I have learned websockets, now it's time
